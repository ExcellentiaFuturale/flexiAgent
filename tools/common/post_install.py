# This script run post install tasks:
#  - device database migrations
#
# Device database migration:
# --------------------------
# Migration is called on post installation or pre removal to/from this release.
# This module is called with three parameters from_version, to_version, install/remove
# From postinst, it is called with install
# From prerm, it is called with remove
# In case of from < to (upgrade) - run only on install
# In case of from > to (downgrade) - run only on remove
# If no version is available, function is called with NULL
#
# The migration script should decide based on the versions how to upgrade or downgrade to/from this release.
#
# Guidelines:
# * If the migrate is backward compatible, run it only on any upgrade to this release and don't run on downgrade
# * Use as much as possible major releases, for example if version 1.2.14 is released, then 1.3.10 is released.
# The migration script in 1.3.10 should run migrations from 1.2.X to 1.3.10 (and not from 1.2.14).
# This allows version 1.2.15 developed after 1.3.10, to upgrade as well.
# * For specific release cases/bugs use the exact version.
