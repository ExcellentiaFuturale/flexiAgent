    'Class to handle STUN requests and responses'
    """
    The router configuration file contains a list of interfaces that are
    added to the system. We go over the file and scan for "add-interface" keys.
    For that key, we look for its IP address and GW address. If the interface has
    both IP address and GW address, it means it can access the internet. If this
    is the case, we need to find out, if we're behind NAT, what is the public
    IP and port of that address.
    So we add them to a section on a global cache, and sends STUN request for
    each of the addresses. For those we get an answer, we mark a 'success' flag.
    For those we did not, we start resending STUN requests, with increased delay
    between each. We start with 1 sec, then 2, then 4, and ends with 60. Once
    we reach 60 seconds, we continue sending re-transmission of the requests
    every 60 seconds. Note, those counters are managed for each of the addresses
    separately.

    From globals, we use the global cache where following elements are kept:
    {
        'local_ip':
        'gateway':
        'public_ip':
        'public_port':
        'send_time':
        'success':
        'server_index':
        'nat_type':
    }

    Note that for unassigned WAN interfaces we would also like to get public info, to display in UI.
    In that case, the address will be part of the STUN cache, but also part of the unassigned cache.
    More info can be found in unassigned_if.py
